# MLOps-Term-Project: End-to-End MLOps System

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning lifecycle for predicting user ad-click behavior. It is designed to meet MLOps Level 2 maturity standards, incorporating automated CI/CD pipelines, experiment tracking, containerization, and continuous monitoring.

## Team and Role Distribution

* Hasan Can Güler - Data Engineer: Feature Engineering, Hashing, and Feature Cross patterns.
* Ayşe Lara Güneş - ML Engineer (Resilience): Imbalance analysis, Upsampling, and Training Checkpoints.
* Yaren Demirol - ML Engineer: Model Architecture (RF, XGB) and Ensemble Design.
* Gonca Yıldız - MLOps Engineer: MLflow tracking, Experiment logging, and Model Registry.
* Süreyya Yıldırım - DevOps Engineer: CI/CD Pipeline design, GitHub Actions, and Unit Testing.
* Sude Nur Yağ - Deployment Engineer: Dockerization, Stateless FastAPI Serving, and Kubernetes.
* Dolunay Çimen - Monitoring Engineer: Continuous Model Evaluation (CME) and Drift Detection.
